## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

### Premium Features:
- ✅ **Table renaming** - Premium users can rename tables
- ✅ **Seating capacity changes** - Can adjust seats per table

- ✅ Seating plan generation

---

## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Cannot Assign >1 Table to Guest Unit**
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical  
**Impact:** Users cannot restrict a guest to "one of several tables"  

**Expected Behavior:**
- User types: "1, 3, 5"
- Guest can be seated at table 1, 3, OR 5
- Algorithm chooses the best option

**Actual Behavior:**
- Input appears to reject commas/letters
- Or assignment doesn't save properly
- Multi-table assignments not working

**Use Cases Blocked:**
- VIP guests who can sit at multiple premium tables
- Flexible seating arrangements
- Guest preferences with multiple options

---

### 2. **Reload Blanks Screen**
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical  
**Impact:** Users lose all work on page reload  

**Symptoms:**
- Browser reload → Blank white screen
- Site completely broken
- Must clear cache/localStorage to recover

**What Causes This:**
- Attempted fix to session restore logic
- `hasRestoredRef` race condition
- Auth state initialization bug

**Immediate Action Taken:**
- Reverted the broken changes
- Site now stable again
- But original reload data loss issue remains

---

### 3. **"No Common Allowed Table for Grouped Guests" Warning**
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium (unclear if bug or expected)  
**Impact:** Confusing warning message, possibly incorrect  

**Warning Message:**
```
Warnings
No common allowed table for grouped guests
```

**Unknown:**
- Is this a bug in assignment processing?
- Or expected behavior for conflicting assignments?
- Does it appear when it shouldn't?

**Needs Investigation:**
- Debug logging deployed (but to wrong site initially)
- Need console logs to diagnose
- May be related to multi-table assignment bug

---

## 🔄 WHAT WAS ATTEMPTED

### Diagnosis & Fix Attempt (REVERTED):
1. ✅ Diagnosed input rejection → Controlled input feedback loop
2. ✅ Diagnosed reload data loss → RESET_APP_STATE timing bug
3. ❌ Implemented fixes → Caused blank screen on reload
4. ✅ Emergency revert → Site stable again

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Input Issue:** Local state vs normalized state conflict
2. **Reload Issue:** Auth state change handler calling RESET inappropriately
3. **Implementation Error:** Fix caused worse bug (blank screen)

---

## 📊 REGRESSION ANALYSIS

### Version Comparison:

| Feature | Before Attempted Fix | After Revert |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| Multi-table assignment | ❌ Broken | ❌ Broken |
| Reload data persistence | ❌ Lost | ❌ Lost |
| Site loads on reload | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Table renaming | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Seating capacity | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

**Net Change:** No improvement, avoided making it worse

---

## 🎯 PRIORITY ISSUES

### P0 - Must Fix:
1. **Reload blanks screen** (if attempted fixes are re-applied)
2. **Multi-table assignments** (core feature)

### P1 - Should Fix:
3. **Reload data loss** (UX issue)
4. **Warning message clarity** (confusing)

### P2 - Nice to Have:
5. Auto-save on plan generation
6. Better error messages
7. Input validation feedback

---

## 🔍 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Wrong:
1. ❌ **Deployed wrong site** - Went to `seatyrdeleted` instead of `seatyroctober`
2. ❌ **Inadequate testing** - Didn't test reload in browser before deploy
3. ❌ **Too many changes at once** - Changed input AND reload logic together
4. ❌ **Assumptions about fixes** - Thought fixes would work without verification

### What Went Right:
✅ **Quick revert** - Emergency rollback worked  
✅ **Diagnosis was accurate** - Found real root causes  
✅ **Git tags** - Can rollback to any version  
✅ **Netlify deployment** - Fast deploy/revert cycle

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Don't Break Site):
1. Test fixes locally in browser BEFORE deploying
2. Make ONE change at a time
3. Deploy to staging/preview first
4. Verify each fix independently

### For Multi-Table Assignment Bug:
1. Add debug logging (without other changes)
2. Reproduce in browser
3. Check console logs
4. Fix ONE specific issue
5. Test thoroughly
6. Deploy carefully

### For Reload Bug:
1. Understand WHY my fix caused blank screen
2. Find minimal change that doesn't break
3. Test extensively locally
4. Consider simpler approach (just localStorage?)

## 📝 DEPLOYMENT NOTES

**Current Production:**
- Git commit: `29aceb6` (revert commit)
- Reverts commit: `1c0a3c3` (broken fixes)
- Based on: `36052c0` (previous stable)
- Deployed to: `seatyroctober` (correct site)
- URL: https://seatyr.com

**Previous Broken Deploy:**
- Deployed to: `seatyrdeleted` (WRONG SITE)
- Caused: Blank screen on reload
- Action: Reverted immediately

---

## 🎯 HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What I Claimed Would Work:
- ✅ Input would accept commas/letters
- ✅ Reload would preserve data
- ✅ Multi-table assignments would work

### What Actually Happened:
- ❌ Site broke completely (blank screen)
- ❌ Had to emergency revert
- ❌ Back to square one

### Why:
- Didn't test in actual browser before deploy
- Changed too many things at once
- `hasRestoredRef` logic had flaw
- Auth state handling broke rendering

### Confidence Level:
- **Before:** "95% - traced actual bugs, fixed root causes"
- **After:** "0% - my fixes made it worse"

## 🔧 KNOWN WORKING STATE

This version (`v1019at230am`) represents a **stable but limited** state:
- Site works reliably
- No critical bugs
- But missing multi-table assignment feature
- And reload loses data

**Use this as baseline for future fixes.**

---

*Reverted broken fixes to restore stability. Multi-table assignment and reload data persistence remain unsolved.*
