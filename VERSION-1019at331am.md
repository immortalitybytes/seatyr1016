## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES: Route-Dependent Reload Behavior

### **UNSIGNED-IN (Anonymous Users)**

| Route | Reload Behavior | Navigation Behavior |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Main (Guests)** | ❌ BLANKS/RESETS (perpetual spinner) | ❌ Data lost |
| **Tables** | ❌ Broken | ❌ Data lost |
| **Your Rules** | ❌ Broken | ❌ Data lost |
| **Seating** | 🟡 Stable reload | ❌ Data lost on nav |

**Summary:** Anonymous reload is CRITICALLY BROKEN. Even Seating page (which reloads) loses data when navigating to other pages.

---

### **PREMIUM (Signed-in Users)**

| Route | Reload Behavior | Navigation Behavior |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Guests (main)** | ✅ STABLE | ✅ Works |
| **Tables** | ❌ BROKEN | ? |
| **Your Rules** | ✅ STABLE | ✅ Works |
| **Seating** | ❌ BROKEN | ? |

**Summary:** Premium has PARTIAL functionality. Main and Rules pages work, Tables and Seating do not.

---

## 📊 BEHAVIOR PATTERNS

### **Pattern 1: Route-Specific Stability**
- Some routes reload fine (Guests, Your Rules for premium)
- Other routes perpetual spinner or blank (Main for anon, Tables, Seating)
- **Hypothesis:** Different routes have different data dependencies

### **Pattern 2: User Type Discrimination**
- Anonymous users: Worse behavior overall
- Premium users: Better but still broken on some routes
- **Hypothesis:** Session initialization timing differs

### **Pattern 3: Data Loss on Navigation**
- Anonymous: Data lost when navigating between pages
- Even routes that reload successfully lose data on nav
- **Hypothesis:** State not persisting during route changes

---

## 🔍 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### **Why Route-Dependent?**

1. **Different Data Requirements**
   - Guests page: Requires `state.guests` (can be empty)
   - Seating page: Requires `state.seatingPlans` (might be undefined)
   - Tables page: Requires `state.tables` (should always exist)
   - Your Rules: Requires `state.constraints` (can be empty)

2. **Initialization Race Conditions**
   - `checkInitialSession` runs async
   - React Router renders routes immediately
   - Some routes access state before it's ready
   - Results in blank screen or spinner

3. **Session Tag Timing**
   - SessionTag starts as 'INITIALIZING'
   - Loading screen shows while 'INITIALIZING' or 'AUTHENTICATING'
   - On some routes, sessionTag never changes
   - Perpetual spinner

---

## 🐛 ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### **Cause 1: Async Init Not Completing**
```typescript
// checkInitialSession is async but might fail silently
const checkInitialSession = async () => {
  try {
    // ... async operations
    setSessionTag('ANON'); // ← Might never reach here
  } catch (err) {
    setSessionTag('ANON'); // ← Or fails here
  }
};
```

**Problem:** If async fails silently, sessionTag stays 'INITIALIZING', perpetual spinner.

### **Cause 2: Data Not Restored Before Route Renders**
```typescript
// Order of operations on reload:
1. AppContext mounts (sessionTag = 'INITIALIZING')
2. Loading screen shows
3. checkInitialSession starts
4. sessionTag set to 'ANON'
5. Loading screen removes
6. Router renders route
7. localStorage restore happens ← TOO LATE!
```

**Problem:** State restore happens AFTER component tries to read it.

### **Cause 3: Navigation Clears State**
```typescript
// Might be dispatching RESET or CLEAR somewhere on navigation
// Or localStorage not being read on route change
```

**Problem:** State cleared during route changes.

## 💡 HYPOTHESES TO TEST

### **Hypothesis 1: Console Logs**
On each broken route, check console for:
- `[Init] Starting session check...` - Did init start?
- `[Init] Session tag set to ANON` - Did it complete?
- `[Session Restore] Anonymous user state restored` - Was data restored?
- Any errors?

### **Hypothesis 2: LocalStorage State**
Before reload, check: `localStorage.getItem('seatyr_app_state')`
- Is data being saved?
- Is it complete (guests, constraints, assignments)?

### **Hypothesis 3: State During Render**
In broken routes, add: `console.log('[Route] State:', state)`
- Does state exist?
- Is it empty or undefined?
- Does it have guests/constraints?

---

## 🔧 POTENTIAL FIXES

### **Fix 1: Remove Loading Screen Entirely** (Risky)
```typescript
// Just show app immediately, let routes handle loading
if (sessionTag === 'INITIALIZING') {
  // Don't return loading screen, return app with sessionTag
  // Let routes decide what to show
}
```

### **Fix 2: Synchronous Session Check** (Might help)
```typescript
// Try to make restore synchronous for anonymous
const saved = localStorage.getItem('seatyr_app_state');
if (saved) {
  dispatch({ type: 'IMPORT_STATE', payload: JSON.parse(saved) });
}
setSessionTag('ANON'); // Immediately, no async
```

### **Fix 3: Route-Level Loading States** (Safest)
```typescript
// Each route checks if it has required data
const GuestsPage = () => {
  if (sessionTag === 'INITIALIZING') return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!state.guests) return <div>No guests yet</div>;
  // ... render
};
```

### **Fix 4: Disable React.StrictMode** (Quick test)
```typescript
// StrictMode causes double renders in dev
// Might be causing race conditions
// Try disabling to see if behavior improves
```

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### **Step 1: Gather Data**
For each broken route:
1. Open DevTools console
2. Reload
3. Note which logs appear
4. Check localStorage before/after
5. Document exact error or missing log

### **Step 2: Identify Pattern**
- Which routes share code paths?
- Which use different hooks?
- What's different about working vs broken routes?

### **Step 3: Minimal Fix**
- Fix ONE route at a time
- Test extensively before moving to next
- Don't change AppContext for route-specific issues

## 📝 KNOWN GOOD STATES

### **Routes That Work (Premium):**
- `/` (Guests/main page)
- `/constraints` (Your Rules)

### **Routes That Fail:**
- `/` (for anonymous!) 
- `/tables` (both user types)
- `/seating` (both user types)

### **Commonality of Working Routes:**
- Simple data requirements (can render with empty arrays)
- No complex derived state
- No seatingPlans dependency

### **Commonality of Failing Routes:**
- Complex data requirements?
- Derived state computations?
- Async data loading?

## 🚨 SEVERITY ASSESSMENT

**Critical (P0):**
- Anonymous main page reload (perpetual spinner) - **SHOWSTOPPER**
- Data loss on navigation for anonymous - **SHOWSTOPPER**

**High (P1):**
- Premium Tables page reload
- Premium Seating page reload

**Medium (P2):**
- Multi-table assignments still not working
- Premium table name assignments still not working

## 🔄 COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS

| Issue | v1019at230am | v1019at331am |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Blank screen | ❌ All routes | 🟡 Some routes |
| Data persistence | ❌ Broken | 🟡 Partial |
| Anonymous reload | ❌ Broken | ❌ Still broken |
| Premium reload | ❌ Broken | 🟡 Works on 2 routes |

**Progress:** Slight improvement for premium users, but anonymous still critically broken.

## 💭 HONEST ASSESSMENT

**My Attempted Fixes:**
1. ❌ Replaced invisible render gate → Caused different issues
2. ❌ Added error handling → Still has problems  
3. ❌ Fixed RESET timing → Helped premium, broke anonymous

**Current State:**
- More console logging (good for debugging)
- Route-dependent behavior (complex to fix)
- No clear single root cause

**What I Should Do Next:**
1. Stop making big changes
2. Gather data from user testing
3. Fix ONE specific route
4. Test extensively before proceeding

*This version has partial improvements but critical reload functionality remains broken for most scenarios. Need to step back and diagnose more carefully before attempting more fixes.*
