# üîç ASSIGNMENT WARNING INVESTIGATION

**Production URL:** https://seatyrdeleted.netlify.app  
**Debug Deploy:** `68f48374a0a57a6be6552c51`  
**Warning:** "No common allowed table for grouped guests"

---

## üéØ WHAT THIS WARNING MEANS

This warning appears when:
1. **Guests are grouped together** (via MUST constraints or adjacency)
2. **Each guest has table assignments**
3. **But there's NO overlap** between their allowed tables

### Example Scenario:
```
Guest A: Assigned to tables "1, 2"
Guest B: Assigned to tables "3, 4"  
Constraint: A MUST sit with B
Result: No common table ‚Üí Warning!
```

## üî¨ DEBUGGING DEPLOYED

I've added comprehensive logging to help diagnose this:

### **Assignment Processing Logs:**
```javascript
[Assignment Debug] {
  guest: "guest-id",
  raw: "1,3,5",
  normalized: "1,3,5", 
  warnings: [],
  tables: [{ id: 1, name: "Table 1" }, ...]
}
```

### **Group Processing Logs:**
```javascript
[Group Debug] Processing group: {
  members: ["guest-a", "guest-b"],
  groupType: "grouped"
}

[Member Debug] {
  member: "guest-a",
  raw: "1,3",
  list: ["1", "3"],
  memberAllowed: ["1", "3"],
  idToTableKeys: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
}

[Group Result] {
  members: ["guest-a", "guest-b"],
  groupAllowed: [],
  groupAllowedSize: 0
}

[Assignment Conflict] No common allowed table for grouped guests: ["guest-a", "guest-b"]
```

## üß™ HOW TO REPRODUCE & DEBUG

### **Step 1: Open Browser Console**
1. Go to https://seatyrdeleted.netlify.app
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Clear console

### **Step 2: Create Test Scenario**
1. Add 2 guests: "Alice" and "Bob"
2. Set constraint: Alice MUST sit with Bob
3. Assign Alice to tables "1, 2"
4. Assign Bob to tables "3, 4"
5. Generate seating plan

### **Step 3: Check Console Logs**
Look for these log patterns:

#### **If Assignment Processing Works:**
```
[Assignment Debug] { guest: "alice-id", raw: "1,2", normalized: "1,2", warnings: [] }
[Assignment Debug] { guest: "bob-id", raw: "3,4", normalized: "3,4", warnings: [] }
```

#### **If Group Processing Works:**
```
[Group Debug] Processing group: { members: ["alice-id", "bob-id"], groupType: "grouped" }
[Member Debug] { member: "alice-id", raw: "1,2", list: ["1", "2"], memberAllowed: ["1", "2"] }
[Member Debug] { member: "bob-id", raw: "3,4", list: ["3", "4"], memberAllowed: ["3", "4"] }
[Group Result] { members: ["alice-id", "bob-id"], groupAllowed: [], groupAllowedSize: 0 }
[Assignment Conflict] No common allowed table for grouped guests: ["alice-id", "bob-id"]
```

## üîç POTENTIAL CAUSES

### **Cause 1: Assignment Not Saved (Most Likely)**
**Symptom:** Raw input shows but no `[Assignment Debug]` logs
**Cause:** User typed assignment but didn't blur/Enter
**Fix:** Ensure assignment is saved before generating plans

### **Cause 2: Table ID Type Mismatch**
**Symptom:** `memberAllowed: []` despite valid assignments
**Cause:** Engine expects string IDs but gets numeric
**Fix:** Check `idToTableKeys` vs assignment tokens

### **Cause 3: Assignment Parsing Bug**
**Symptom:** `normalized: ""` or `warnings: ["Unknown table ID: ..."]`
**Cause:** `normalizeAssignmentInputToIdsWithWarnings` fails
**Fix:** Check table names/IDs in assignment processing

### **Cause 4: Expected Behavior**
**Symptom:** All logs show correct processing, but no overlap
**Cause:** User intentionally assigned conflicting tables
**Fix:** This is correct - user needs to fix assignments

---

## üéØ MOST LIKELY SCENARIO

Based on my recent changes to input handling, I suspect:

### **The Problem:**
1. User types assignment "1, 3" in input field
2. Input shows "1, 3" (raw state)
3. User clicks "Generate Seating Plan" 
4. **Assignment never gets saved** (no blur/Enter)
5. Engine gets empty assignment
6. Warning appears

### **The Fix:**
Ensure assignments are saved before plan generation, or auto-save on plan generation.

---

## üîß QUICK DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

### **Question 1: Are assignments being saved?**
Check console for `[Assignment Debug]` logs. If missing ‚Üí assignments not saved.

### **Question 2: Are table IDs correct?**
Check `idToTableKeys` in `[Member Debug]`. Should be `["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]`.

### **Question 3: Are guests actually grouped?**
Check `[Group Debug]` for `groupType: "grouped"`. If `single` ‚Üí no constraint exists.

### **Question 4: Is this expected behavior?**
If Alice assigned to "1,2" and Bob to "3,4" with MUST constraint ‚Üí warning is correct!

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### **If It's a Bug (assignments not saved):**
1. Add auto-save on plan generation
2. Show warning if assignments are pending
3. Force save all pending assignments

### **If It's Expected Behavior:**
1. Improve warning message
2. Suggest overlapping tables
3. Show which guests conflict

### **If It's a Parsing Bug:**
1. Fix `normalizeAssignmentInputToIdsWithWarnings`
2. Fix table ID mapping
3. Fix assignment format conversion

## üìä DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

Use this checklist when testing:

- [ ] **Console shows assignment processing logs**
- [ ] **Table IDs match between assignments and engine**
- [ ] **Guests are actually grouped (MUST constraint exists)**
- [ ] **Assignments have overlapping tables**
- [ ] **Assignment format is correct ("1,3,5" not [1,3,5])**

---

## üí° MY HYPOTHESIS

**Most likely cause:** My input changes created a workflow where users can type assignments but they don't get saved until blur/Enter. If users click "Generate" without blurring, assignments are empty.

**Quick test:** Type an assignment, don't press Enter or click away, then generate plans. Check console for missing `[Assignment Debug]` logs.
